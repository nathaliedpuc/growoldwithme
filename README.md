This project has been exported from [Spline](https://spline.design/).

## Usage

To preview the project locally, first install the dependencies with your package manager of choice, using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/):

```

Then you can start the local dev server with

```
pnpm dev
```

## Deployment

You can use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or your server provider of choice to host the website.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're deploying to a subdirectory (like `example.com/app/`), you might need to change the `wasmPath` prop in `page.tsx` accordingly.
